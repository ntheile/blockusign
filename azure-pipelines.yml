# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# pool:
#   vmImage: 'Ubuntu 16.04'

# variables:
#   buildConfiguration: 'Release'

# steps:
# - task: NodeTool@0
#   inputs:
#     versionSpec: '8.x'
    
# - script: |
#     cd Blockusign.Ionic
#     npm install
#     npm install -g ionic@latest
#     ionic build
